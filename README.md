## Hey! I'm Shreyas Bhagwat. ðŸ‘‹
A prefinal student pursuing Btech (Computer Science and Engineering) from Vellore Institute of Technology.

Java is the language I love to code in. Due to my inclination towards java, I developed an interest in Android development too and have been working and practicing in the same.
I have a great interest in developing things and always eager to learn new stuff.
